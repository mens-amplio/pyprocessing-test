Bare bones pyprocessing test app. Create nodes and edges (with associated color info) in a graph (network.py), pass the graph into an emulator (emulator.py) which launches a visualizer app (visualizer.py). 

The utils subdirectory has an amplio_utils.py file with the actual LED-drawing function, plus some third-party code that allows you to rotate the model in 3 dimensions.

The graph portion of this is extremely impoverished.

Run python test.py
